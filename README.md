## Description

A bolt task which allows you to update Juniper devices with configurations snippets.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
another module, etc.), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you might want to include an additional "Upgrading" section here.

### Beginning with juniper_config

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This
can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most basic
use of the module.

## Usage

Include usage examples for common use cases in the **Usage** section. Show your
users how to use your module to solve problems, and be sure to include code
examples. Include three to five examples of the most important or common tasks a
user can accomplish with your module. Show users how to accomplish more complex
tasks that involve different types, classes, and functions working in tandem.

## Reference

This section is deprecated. Instead, add reference information to your code as
Puppet Strings comments, and then use Strings to generate a REFERENCE.md in your
module. For details on how to add code comments and generate documentation with
Strings, see the [Puppet Strings documentation][2] and [style guide][3].

If you aren't ready to use Strings yet, manually create a REFERENCE.md in the
root of your module directory and list out each of your module's classes,
defined types, facts, functions, Puppet tasks, task plans, and resource types
and providers, along with the parameters for each.

For each element (class, defined type, function, and so on), list:

* The data type, if applicable.
* A description of what the element does.
* Valid values, if the data type doesn't make it obvious.
* Default value, if any.

For example:

```
### `pet::cat`

#### Parameters

##### `meow`

Enables vocalization in your cat. Valid options: 'string'.

Default: 'medium-loud'.
```

## Limitations

In the Limitations section, list any incompatibilities, known issues, or other
warnings.

## Development

In the Development section, tell other users the ground rules for contributing
to your project and how they should submit their work.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel are
necessary or important to include here. Please use the `##` header.
